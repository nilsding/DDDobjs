# artwork-holder

Another thing that does one specific thing -- it's a wall mount for certain
thick art prints.

Print this at least twice for optimal stability.  Ensure the nails in the wall
are aligned properly, otherwise the artwork will be skewed.

## Print hints

Print it on its side with a brim.  PLA is fine for indoor usage.
