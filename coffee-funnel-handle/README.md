# coffee-funnel-handle

This is a handle that carries the coffee funnel of a Bialetti Moka Express.

I made this to use it with the coffee grinder I have, a [GRAEF CM702][graef].
It starts grinding the coffee when the button on the front is pushed inwards,
which feels odd to do with just the aluminium funnel of the bialetti.

One of the first things I created in OpenSCAD, and definitely one of the more
useful ones ;-)
