# webcam-mount

This is a thing to mount a Logitech B905/C905 webcam on the Z-axis of an Ender
3.

The design is somewhat based on the
[camera mount by Flapstaart on Thingiverse][thingiverse], except it is
installed on the Z axis directly.

## Print hints

Print `webcam-mount` sideways with the long arm on the bed --> no supports
required.  `webcam-mount-screw` doesn't need any supports either.

Printing with PLA at 0.20mm layer height works fine.

## Installation

Screw the `webcam-mount-screw` onto the webcam (you might need to remove some
cover on the back to unveil the screw).

For now install it on the Z axis by using double-sided tape.  It's not pretty
but it works ;-)

I used a M4x14 screw and nut to hold the two parts together.
