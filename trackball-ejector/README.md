# trackball-ejector

This is a thingy that helps with ejecting the trackball of a Logitech MX Ergo.

I didn't need this with my old M570, as the hole below the trackball was large
enough for my pinky finger to poke through.  The MX Ergo's one is much smaller
though, so that didn't work anymore.

## Print hints

This is a quick & easy print.  I sliced it with whatever default settings
PrusaSlicer has for generic PLA filament, and no brim.  It takes around 13
minutes to print.
